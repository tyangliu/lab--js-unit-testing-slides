Code intro
- what x provides

Primer on callbacks/promises
- blocking code vs. nonblocking what it looks like
- it will freeze the UI

Testing callbacks
- sinon spies

Testing promises
- chai-as-promised

Mocking XHR
- sinon fake xhr / server

Testing Angular
- no difference other than angular's own way of 'loading' modules

Karma
- loads and runs your tests in a browser, providing instant feedback
- tests automatically run everytime you make a code change
  (it's okay because it's so fast)
